    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Homemade oat milk, cheap and easy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup whole rolled oats</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the oats, water, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt in a blender and blend for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and strain the milk without pushing any excess pulp through the strainer. This will create a creamier texture thatâ€™s not gritty or gummy.</li>
        <li>Add more maple syrup, to taste, if desired. Chill overnight. If you want to drink your oat milk right away, I recommend adding ice - it's flavor is best when well chilled.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>If you're gluten free, be sure to get oats that are Certified Gluten Free.</p>
    <p>As the oat milk sits in the fridge, natural separation will occur. You can shake it, if you like, but I like it's texture best when I leave pulp at the bottom and pour off the top.</p>
